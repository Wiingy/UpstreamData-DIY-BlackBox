## Step 3: Preparation

This is the drawing that was used to prepare the OSB, asphalt board, and Dense Shield. All layers of these three materials in the guide were glued together with the Liquid Nails as the individual pieces were assembled. All pieces were first cut to these rough dimensions. Depending on the materials you decide to use for lining your enclosure, the final dimensions may vary. Starting with these rough dimensions is recommended, then during the assembly process you will be able to cut down pieces to be the correct size accordingly. 

For example, the final exterior dimensions of the enclosure are 32" H x 33" L x 16" W. However, the dimensions of the interior pieces were only 13-1/2" wide because of the space taken up by the lining materials. The dimensions of the pieces you use on the interior of your enclosure will be determined by the thickness of the lining materials you have selected. 

The OSB, asphalt board, and Dense Shield were all cut to the sizes of the pieces in the drawing above.
