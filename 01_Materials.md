## Step 1: Materials
The first step is to gather the materials you want. These are the materials shown in this guide, but feel free to experiment with other materials. Be mindful of fire risks and be thinking about what hazards you introduce into your home with this kind of project. Always consult a licensed electrician before plugging in mining equipment.  

Everything used for materials on this project was purchased from Home Depot for just under $150.00 USD at the time of writing, January 2022. There are a variety of materials to use for lining the inside of the enclosure. You do not need to use the materials listed here. The reasoning for these specific materials will be discussed below but feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.

The Fromply was chosen for outside weather resistant, Villaboard chosen as its easier to glue the sound asorber to villaboard then the Formply, if you want to only use formply and sound asorber, please use orbital sander to sand down the black layer on the formply.

Use the sealant between the formply and villaboard, (used with screws aswell).  Use the 3M 90 Spray Adhesive to stick Stratocell to the Villaboard.  Please be aware of the strict materials that can be used with the Stratocell.

I also included an inline filter and duct to suck fresh air from outside and then push it back outside.  More material will be needed to secure ducting into box
