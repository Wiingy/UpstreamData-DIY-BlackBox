## Conclusion
This guide should have given you the basic explanations needed to see how you can build an indoor rated enclosure that will attenuate the noise of the ASIC by as much as 20dB. Different materials can be experimented with to try and achieve even more noise attenuation. For less than $150 and some elbow grease, this is a great solution for DIY enthusiasts who want to build their own enclosure based on the BlackBox design from Upstream Data. Be mindful of fire risks and be thinking about what hazards you introduce into your home with this kind of project. Always consult a licensed electrician before plugging in mining equipment.  

You may also wish to add an air filter to your enclosure to help keep dust and debris out of your ASIC. Check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkjRKIRva58) for an in depth review of common furnace style air filters. You can attach a filter to the intake-side of the enclosure with foil tape to get a tight seal. 

There are many great resources from DIY enthusiasts that have been building off of the original BlackBox idea:
